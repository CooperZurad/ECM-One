## Welcome ##

The ECM One is an experimental and early access machine designed as a stable platform for research, experimentation, and basic manufacturing.
There will be additional proven electrodes available for download as we can verify their function. More electrodes designed by the community may also be hosted here in the future.
For direct questions about operation of the ECM One and fastest response, please refer to our Keybase team, keybase://team-page/zurad_collab.

This machine is a work in progress. Please send feedback, suggestions, or wishlists to us directly by messaging us here on GitHub, https://keybase.io/zurad, or info@zurad.engineering.
